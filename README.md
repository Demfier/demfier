### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student at the [NLP Lab](https://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/NLP_lab.html) of the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). My research primarily focuses on multimodal deep learning. I am currently working on techniques to combine visual and auditory cues to generate better text.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I love [art](https://demfier.github.io/art/) :art:
- I (religiously) watch anime (いけ、なると!) :godmode:
- I'm learning Japanese :jp: and French :fr:
- I'm learning the piano :musical_keyboard: (ahem, ahem, a little paused right now, this endeavour is)
- I'm vegan :cow2:
