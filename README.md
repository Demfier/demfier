### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [NLP Lab](https://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/NLP_lab.html) of the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). My research primarily focuses on how to use large language models as an assistive tool for various creative and education tasks.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I love art [(my art)](https://demfier.github.io/art/) :art:
- I'm learning Japanese :jp:
- I'm also learning the piano :musical_keyboard:
- I (used to) religiously watch anime
