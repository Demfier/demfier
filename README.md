### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student at the [NLP Lab](https://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/NLP_lab.html) of the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). My research primarily focuses on multimodal deep learning. I am currently working on techniques to combine visual and auditory cues to generate better text.
